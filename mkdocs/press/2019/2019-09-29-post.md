# Welcome to the new site (9/29)

Welcome to the brand new Hyperspace website! We hope that this edition of the website makes it easier to sift through documentation and to keep in touch with the latest changes in Hyperspace.

We also have a brand new blog to keep you up to date on what's happening in the Hyperspace community.
