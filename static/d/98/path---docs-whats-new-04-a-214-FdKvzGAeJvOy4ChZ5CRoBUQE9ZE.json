It only makes sense.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bug fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Hyperspace wasn't really good with names, especially when they weren't Latin characters. We helped Hyperspace get over its fear of display names when it comes to creating initials for these cases, which should mean that it doesn't break down, cry, and crash on you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.2</h1>\n<h1>0.1</h1>","frontmatter":{"title":"What's new in Hyperspace","path":"/docs/whats-new","description":"Read about the latest changes to Hyperspace."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"pathSlug":"/docs/whats-new"}}
