To make the contribution process quick, smooth, easy, and fun, we've devised a set of guidelines. Please consult these when making a pull request, issue, etc. General Code Guidelines These guidelines apply to code that is written in Hyperspace. Declare styles with components (NEW) Hyperspace 1.0 uses the Material-UI framework to create beautiful design that scales across devices. Part of using this framework includes defining styles right inside of the code as JSS . As such, we recommend adding a file dedicated to your styles in the component's folder and writing in the styles accordingly. If possible, use a type Hyperspace uses custom types via TypeScript to specify variables, parameters, and other parts of code to prevent ambiguity. If it is possible to use an existing type from src/types (or other types from project libraries) or make a new type, use it. Otherwise, use any as the type. Suffice to say, this also means that new components or code should be written in TypeScript files (.ts, .tsx) unless there is a compatibility issue that prevents this from working properly. Keep code organized The Hyperspace structure is organized based on utilities, components, tests, and other types of files to make everything easy to locate. Please try to keep this organization when making a new component or test. Issues These guidelines apply to issues on GitHub. Be as descriptive and concise as possible So that Hyerpspace contributors and developers can better understand what the issue or request may be, issue descriptions should be concise but also descrptive. Refrain from writing an issue in a convoluted way that confuses others. Additionally, if you feel using a screenshot or video will better illustrate your description, add them in conjuction with (or to replace) the description. Remember to consult the Screenshot Guidelines . Label your issue during creation Issues are categorized by types such as bug , enhancement , question , etc. by contributors that can access labels. Since it isn't possible to tag an issue during creation, prepend the tag to your issue's title. Example [Enhancement request] Support settings sync with TorielDB Pull Requests These guides apply to pull requests on GitHub. Describe all of your changes Pull requests generally include many changes that address a particular problem or a set of problems. Explain all of the changes you made, but refrain from listing all of these changes as commit messages. Example This PR makes the following changes: Custom emojis from the user's server can be used in a post by typing its shortcode or inserting it through the new emoji picker*. Posts and profile names display custom emoji. A new utility, emojifyHTML, will automatically replace emoji shortcodes with img elements. Reference existing issues and PRs If applicable, pull requests will reference the issues they are fixing in the description. This helps organize contributions in a few ways: Automates closing issues when they are fixed Verifies that the pull request fixes the issue(s) in question Makes a reference in the issue's thread for context If there are any documented issues that the pull request addresses, reference them in the description of the pull request. Example Use TorielDB to sync data (fixes #1) (Optional) Sign-off your code Hyperspace contributors try to credit pull request contributors in release notes as a way of saying thanks. Another way to ensure that we credit the right person if by signing-off your code. This can be done either in the pull request's description or the latest commit pushed to branch linked with the pull request: Signed - off - by : Your Name youremail @email . com This isn't required but is good practice to confirm that you wrote the code so we can credit it accordingly. Screenshots These guidelines apply to screenshots that are used for reference in issues and/or pull requests. Respect the post author's visibility Mastodon supports posting to four different visibility levels. As a means of respecting privacy, please keep in mind the following: Do not post a status published as a direct message, followers-only, or unlisted status unless you have explicit permission from the status author. If you made a direct message to yourself to demo a feature or fix a bug present in a post, you do not need to worry. If you are unsure whether a public status should be included in a screenshot, consult the post author. Ensure screenshots are clear Screenshots are often included to help illustrate or demonstrate a point with an issue or pull request. It may be difficult to understand the screenshot's purpose if the image is too small or distorted. Ensure that all screenshots are clear and visible.","title":"Contribution Guidelines"},{"location":"contributing/#contribution-guidelines","text":"Thank you for contributing to Hyperspace!

What's new: Fixes a bug where valid instances were marked as \"invalid\" (#105) 1.0.0 (October 11, 2019) Hyperspace 1.0.0 is the next-generation release of Hyperspace. It contains many great improvements and features and is a recommended update for all users and developers. What's new: Complete and responsive redesign using the Material design language that extends to desktops New settings to change the color scheme, default visibility, and more Support using multiple accounts within Hyperspace Ability to manage blocked servers easily Support for searching accounts, hashtags, and related posts Viewing and managing follow requests and recommended follows Brand-new composer with better attachments and poll support Complete customization with a config file for administrators Better notification support with ability to dismiss individual notifications and seeing a badge count (macOS/Linux only) A brand-new menubar for desktop apps with keyboard shortcuts 0.7 (March 26, 2019) This release continues to build on the 0.x release with bug fixes, improvements, and new features. Note: This will be the last release from the 0.x branch of Hyperspace. Future versions of Hyperspace will be released and maintained on hyperspacedev/hyperspace , which sports a brand new design and many more features to come. New features Get your vote on! The new polls feature from Mastodon has been added to Hyperspace. Create and vote on polls from any post. Express yourself with custom emojis! The emoji picker now brings in custom emojis from your server and posts will render custom emojis. \ud83d\ude4c Make posts faster with new Keyboard Shortcuts! Press 'N' on the home screen to open the composer. More keyboard shortcuts are found in the compose window. Improvements The carousel has been redesigned so that it remains a certain size, but images will still look nice. More loaders have been placed in. This should reduce ambiguity in many places. The composer has been completely overhauled with better image uploads (and new description support for screen readers and tooltips), emoji picker, visibility settings as a dropdown, warning system, and more. The reply window now displays the full HTML contents of a post and uses the same element from the composer. The composer at the top has been replaced with a compose button at the bottom of the window for quick access anywhere. Boost cards have a slight redesign that shows the full content and displays a regular tooltip. Images on posts have descriptions displayed on hover as a tooltip. Hyperspace's top bar is now visible at all times and is slimmer than before. Developer changes The Composable element has been introduced as a means of making new elements that create or reply to posts. This is the basis for the Composer and the reply window. This marks the last release of the 0.x series. Further developments are on the main hyperspace repository. Bug fixes Clicking the link to an image in the composer no longer makes the desktop app unusable. Grammarly has been disabled on the composer textarea to prevent collisions with Grammarly and the composer's state. The post date element now says via 'determination (unknown)' when the application isn't known. 0.6.1 (March 9, 2019) This hotfix update fixes a bug that occurred after logging in and viewing the app, causing the page to go blank because it couldn't fetch account data. This update still contains the features and improvements found in version 0.6.0. 0.6 (March 9, 2019) This release continues to build on the 0.x release with bug fixes, improvements, and new features. New features Slideshows for posts are now available! For posts with more than one media item, a now carousel slideshow has been added to view each and every one of them at full-width. A new icon is here! Hyperspace is now represented with a fluffy mastodon with a purple robe. Improvements The login experience has been completely redesigned from the gound up. With a new slick UI, the process for logging into a Mastodon account couldn't get easier. Just enter the username and follow the prompts. The overall file size of applications should be lower now to due exclusion of developer dependencies. People can now press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter in a compose window or reply window to quickly post a status (requested by @BNolet, #19). The overall accuracy of thread panel-opening when clicking a post has been improved. A new media spinner is present when in the process of uploading images or videos for posts and changing profile images. The 'copy link' notification has been converted to an in-app toast notification to prevent app notification clutter. On devices with smaller resolutions, the profile container on the right is trimmed and re-presented at the top, providing quick access to their account page and log out/dark mode options. Timelines can now load older posts with a 'Load more' button at the bottom of the timeline. This also works on profile panels. Emojis in the emoji picker have been replaced with the Noto Color Emoji font. Developer changes Unit and build tests have been added to test components and the overall build process. CI tests have been enabled via Travis CI and make use of the new unit tests and build tests. A new userAgent utility is available to detect if a user is viewing Hyperspace on a mobile device. More files have been converted over to the TypeScript format. The dark mode toggle and lout out buttons are now respective elements. The app's content when logged in is now rendered as an AppContent element. Snap support has been added, allowing developers to build a snap package. jQuery files for Bootstrap have been replaced with Bootstrap.Native scripts, reducing overall Bootstrap errors. There are now two Linux build commands for NPM: npm run build-electron-linux will build all possible Linux targets (deb, AppImage, snap). npm run build-electron-linux-select will build Linux targets in the classic style where an argument is required. Bug fixes A bug that caused Hyperspace to crash due to the event's target returning a Class instead of an HTMLElement when clicking a button on a post has been fixed. A bug that caused the Windows icon to be significantly smaller has been (hopefully) fixed with the new Hyperspace icon. A bug that caused the Linux build command to fail due to an argument not being passed has been resolved. 0.5.5 (February 28, 2019) Release 0.5.5 adds some minor improvements and bug fixes that have been backported from the initial Mac App Store version (note: the MAS version will reflect as 0.5.0 ). Added a New Window menu shortcut App will not crash or throw an error if DevTools cannot be accessed 0.5 (February 24, 2019) This release continues to build on the 0.x release with bug fixes, improvements, and new features. New features Enjoy a brand new dark mode! Toggle dark mode in the toolbar to enjoy an experience that best works with your workflow, whether you take it light or stick to the dark side. Hyperspace expands to PWA and the Mac App Store*! Mobile users can experiment with the new progressive web app mode of Hyperspace, and macOS users can now get Hyperspace from the Mac App Store alongside their other apps. Improvements The login process has been improved. For mobile users and other users that may accidentally leave Hyperspace temporarily, Hyperspace will temporarily save some data to help you resume setting the app up later. In addition, a new 'About' section is available and a banner appears for mobile users that want to add Hyperspace as a progressive web app. macOS icons are now better rendered with pixel-fit icons for lower sizes that match the favicon. A context menu is now available in the desktop version to cut, copy, paste, and search text on DuckDuckGo (requested by @BNolet, #21). The Hyperspace icon on Windows should now appear larger to match the other icons on the system (@PoorPocketsMcNewHold, #32). The favicon in Safari has also been upscaled (@PoorPocketsMcNewHold, #33). The desktop app now has a minimum width to prevent elements from being displayed incorrectly at ridiculously tiny sizes. Posts can now be clicked or tapped on to open the thread besides using the 'Show thread' button (requested by @BNolet, #26). On posts written by the signed-in person, a new 'Delete' button is present to delete the post. Profile panels now display tables like the profile container below their bio. The signed-in person's profile panel now displays buttons to edit their bio (note) and to change avatar/header images. The \"Couldn't get timeline\" has been changed to better represent when a timeline is empty and maybe resulted from an error. The desktop app on macOS now uses a unique titlebar that matches more closely to other macOS apps with Electron. The main scrollbar has been hidden on some browsers to prevent shifting of content (Safari, Chrome, Edge?, desktop). Developer changes The codebase has been migrated over from JavaScript to TypeScript, making it easier to work with types in the Megalodon library. The package now comes with TypeScript dependencies, as well as npm-run-all to run some tasks simultaneously while testing Hyperspace. A new addition to the package manifest includes a command to build the macOS icon from the iconset in the electron folder. The package manifest has also been updated to point to entitlements and provisioning files for the Mac App Store version when building. Bug fixes Overlapped text on timeline tabs has been fixed by not rendering them on mobile devices and truncating the text down to 'Home', 'Local', 'Public', and 'Messages' (requested by @PoorPocketsMcNewHold, #30). 0.4 (February 15, 2019) This release continues to build on the 0.x release with bug fixes, improvements, and new features. New features Profile panels are now live! Quickly view information about a profile and view their latest statuses without leaving Hyperspace. Threads are now visible in Hyperspace! Just click \"Show thread\" to see the previous and next posts for a given status. Improvements Boost cards will now dynamically resize based on the type of content they have, whether it's long text or it contains media. With the new thread feature, they'll now also open their respective thread for further context. Replies can now be more detailed. The reply window now resides as a panel and offers more tools such as uploading media, setting content warnings, and changing the visibility. Links will now open in your respective web browser rather than trying to open in a new Electron window. Content warning buttons will now change colors depending on the type of content in question. Currently, this works best when 'NSFW: ' or 'Spoiler: ' prepends the spoiler text. Clicking a desktop notification will now return you to the app rather than doing nothing. Bug fixes A bug that causes building to fail on Linux because Wine wasn't installed has been resolved by specifying the type of build rather than building for all platforms. If someone follows you and you get notified, Hyperspace will no longer crash or freeze because there wasn't a status attached with it. 0.3 (February 6, 2019) This release continues to build on the 0.x release set with new features, improvements, and bug fixes: New features There's a new emoji picker in town! Click on it to add emoji to your post more easily. (Don't worry, you can still use your native emoji picker if you prefer that). Did you get the message? Conversations (beta) have landed in the timeline! View your recent direct messages and respond to them quickly. Improvements We've updated the stylesheet! We're embracing system defaults for emojis and fonts, as well as add a nice light shade of the theme accent color to better distinguish where postcards are. A log out button had been added to the navigation bar so that it's easier to log out of Hyperspace. The developer tools now will open in a new window by default so that it doesn't take up so much of your precious... hyper- space . We've moved the 'Add/change warning' button to the overflow menu so that the command bar wasn't so cluttered. Some icons have been updated to better represent what the action is. Replies should now match the same visibility settings as the post you're replying to. It only makes sense. Bug fixes Hyperspace wasn't really good with names, especially when they weren't Latin characters. We helped Hyperspace get over its fear of display names when it comes to creating initials for these cases, which should mean that it doesn't break down, cry, and crash on you. 0.2 (February 4, 2019) This version of Hyperspace continues to build on the release of the 0.x series with new improvements and bug fixes: New features Notifications have been introduced! You can find your latest notifications on the right-hand side under your profile card and, in theory, get push notifications for when a new notification comes in. Hyperspace now has an app menu, meaning that you can do things like insert emojis, cut/copy/paste, minimize and make the window full screen, and reload if necessary. Hyperspace now has an auto-updater! This works with Windows and macOS and is delivered via Electron's update service (https://update.electronjs.org). General improvements Icons on the compose window toolbar and the postcards now have a neat hover color. All links now use the theme's accent color instead of Bootstrap's default blue color. Bug fixes Noticed how Hyperspace would seem to freeze after you log in? We talked to the profile container manager and, well, he agreed to no longer hyperkill the app because it didn't register the account details the first time. He might've also agreed on letting Asriel hyperkill him if this happens again. Sometimes, finding the application name would cause Hyperspace to break down in fear. We fixed that up and now display that a Mastodon user tooted with DETERMINATION when we can't find the application name. 0.1 (February 3, 2019) This is the first release. :)","title":"Stable Release Notes"},{"location":"changelog/#stable-release-notes","text":"","title":"Stable Release Notes"},{"location":"changelog/#101-october-26-2019","text":"This update is recommended for all users and developers.

For mobile users and other users that may accidentally leave Hyperspace temporarily, Hyperspace will temporarily save some data to help you resume setting the app up later. In addition, a new 'About' section is available and a banner appears for mobile users that want to add Hyperspace as a progressive web app. macOS icons are now better rendered with pixel-fit icons for lower sizes that match the favicon. A context menu is now available in the desktop version to cut, copy, paste, and search text on DuckDuckGo (requested by @BNolet, #21). The Hyperspace icon on Windows should now appear larger to match the other icons on the system (@PoorPocketsMcNewHold, #32). The favicon in Safari has also been upscaled (@PoorPocketsMcNewHold, #33). The desktop app now has a minimum width to prevent elements from being displayed incorrectly at ridiculously tiny sizes. Posts can now be clicked or tapped on to open the thread besides using the 'Show thread' button (requested by @BNolet, #26). On posts written by the signed-in person, a new 'Delete' button is present to delete the post. Profile panels now display tables like the profile container below their bio. The signed-in person's profile panel now displays buttons to edit their bio (note) and to change avatar/header images. The \"Couldn't get timeline\" has been changed to better represent when a timeline is empty and maybe resulted from an error. The desktop app on macOS now uses a unique titlebar that matches more closely to other macOS apps with Electron. The main scrollbar has been hidden on some browsers to prevent shifting of content (Safari, Chrome, Edge?, desktop).","title":"Improvements"},{"location":"changelog/#developer-changes_2","text":"The codebase has been migrated over from JavaScript to TypeScript, making it easier to work with types in the Megalodon library.

This config file includes branding, licenses, federation support, and a few other configurations. Important As of Hyperspace 1.0.0beta4, all Boolean keys are no longer wrapped as strings; your config file must have all Boolean values as they are. Change Hyperspace's branding The branding background, logo, and name is controlled under the branding key: branding : { name : Hyperspace , logo : logo.svg , background : background.png } , This key is not particularly required for Hyperspace, though it is generally recommended to keep this key in the file. This key has three subkeys: Subkey Default value Description name \"Hyperspace\" The name of the app or of the brand. Affects the app name in the title bar, About page, and other parts what use Hyperspace as the name. logo \"logo.svg\" The location, (relative to the build files), of the logo used on the login screen. background \"background.png\" The location, (relative to the build files), of the background used on the login screen. Manage instance information There are some extra keys for handling actions such as federation, registrations, and instance administrators. There are a few keys in the config file to handle this: Key Default value Description federated n/a Whether the instance of Mastodon is federated or not. This is used to disable access to public fediverse features in Hyperspace for local instances. registration n/a Information regarding registration of the instance. See below for more information admin n/a The administrator that installed Hyperspace. Note As of Hyperspace 1.0.0beta4 +, the federated key now expands to more configuration settings. Registration information Subkey Default value Description defaultInstance \"mastodon.social\" The domain name associated with the Mastodon instance that Hyperspace will connect to by default. This is used to handle well-known logins and direct users to the correct registration page. Important As of Hyperspace 1.0.0beta7, this key will automatically reset to \"mastodon.social\" if it is set to a disallowed domain. Admin information Subkey Default value Description name n/a The name of the administrator. This can be a display name or real name. account n/a The account ID number on the Mastodon network.

We hope you've been enjoying the shiny and fancy 1.0 release(s) of Hyperspace as much as we have making it. This blog post hopes to cover what's going on and what will happen in the future. Coming very soon: Hyperspace v1.0.2 Within the next few days, we plan to release Version 1.0.2 of Hyperspace, which is the second patch update to Hyperspace. Not much has been changed, but there are some improvements: Fixes an issue where the context menu on reblogged posts had an outline in Chrome and the desktop apps Fixes an issue where the release channels in the About page always were listed as \"Release\", despite the developer field in config.json We believe this patch will also fix some App Store issues and let Hyperspace 1.0 return to the Mac App Store shortly. As of right now, you can run this release of Hyperspace by heading to our online sites. Once Apple's notarizations servers are back to normal, we'll release the desktop apps. Future development: Hyperspace v1.1 Of course, we couldn't help ourselves and had to start getting to work on the next feature update to Hyperspace, v1.1. We've started work on some minor improvements, but do plan to release the first beta within the next few weeks (hopefully before Thanksgiving). The first beta for version 1.1 is already looking fascinating as we've implemented a few features we think you'll love: Searching with hashtags should be simpler, so now you can search for your mastocats using #mastocats and not tag:mastocats (though you can still use the old behavior) Our media attachment picker now supports uploading audio files and should match closer to what's offered on the web frontend in terms of files Follow requests are now accessible through the account menu and in Settings instead of the \"Who to follow\" page (we think this makes more sense). On that note, we've also renamed \"Who to follow\" to \"Recommended\". Besides these features, there's one particular feature for the first beta that we think you'll love (we do, too). Since Mastodon 3.0 has been released, apps can access the profile directory and trending hashtags . Because of this, we've taken a look and have created a new section of the app called Activity that will let you see what's trending on your instance, who's been active, and who just signed up. These aren't the only feature updates we plan to add in the 1.1 release, but this first beta should be exciting! You can always take a look at these upcoming features when they enter the beta stages at https://hyperspaceapp-next.herokuapp.com and give us feedback or report issues on our GitHub repository. That's all we have for updates as of right now; be on the lookout for the 1.1 beta! Until next time...
